# react-tabs

Very simple app that displays different data when tabs are clicked. Data is fetched from an API with async/await syntax.

To view, run `npm i && npm start` in downloaded project.

This project was completed as part of a [React tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_7Z7C_JCyo&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) by John Smilga.
